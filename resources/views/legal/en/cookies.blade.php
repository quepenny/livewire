<h3>What is a cookie?</h3>
<p>A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on your device when you visit. It typically contains information about the website itself, a unique identifier that allows the site to recognise your web browser when you return, additional data that serves the cookie’s purpose, and the lifespan of the cookie itself.</p>
<p>Cookies are used to enable certain features (e.g. logging in), track site usage (e.g. analytics), store your user settings (e.g. time zone, notification preferences), and to personalise your content (e.g. advertising, language).</p>
<p>Cookies set by the website you are visiting are usually referred to as first-party cookies. They typically only track your activity on that particular site.</p>
<p>Cookies set by other sites and companies (i.e. third parties) are called third-party cookies. They can be used to track you on other websites that use the same third-party service.</p>
<h3>How Can You Control Our Website's Use of Cookies?</h3>
<p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies on our Website. You can manage your cookie preferences in our Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select which categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with the services on our Website.</p>
<p>You may also be able to set or amend your cookie preferences by managing your web browser settings. As each web browser is different, please consult the instructions provided by your web browser (typically in the &quot;help&quot; section).

<h3>How Often Will We Update This Cookie Policy?</h3>
<p>We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect any changes to the cookies and related technologies we use, or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.</p>
